# Next.js Routing Showcase

A small, runnable reference for file-system routing in the Next.js App Router. Every convention below has a working route in [`app/`](app) and a short explanation in [`docs/`](docs).

Built with Next.js, React, strict TypeScript (typed routes) and CSS Modules. Exact versions are pinned in [`package.json`](package.json); CI runs on the Node.js version set in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. The home page links to every pattern.

CI runs the same checks you can run locally:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck              # next typegen && tsc --noEmit
npm run format:check
npm run build
npm run route-map -- --check   # README route map matches the build
```

## Route map

Every route in the app, generated from the `next build` output by [`scripts/route-map.mts`](scripts/route-map.mts). After changing routes, run `npm run build && npm run route-map`; CI fails if this table is out of date.

Rendering, as reported by `next build`: **static** is prerendered at build time, **SSG** is prerendered once per `generateStaticParams` entry, **dynamic** is rendered on each request.

| `template.tsx`     | Like a layout, but remounts when its own segment (including dynamic params) changes.    |
| `loading.tsx`      | Suspense fallback for the segment. Makes the response stream; see below.                |
| `error.tsx`        | Error boundary for the segment. `retry()` re-fetches and re-renders it (Next.js 16.3+). |
| `global-error.tsx` | Replaces the root layout when it throws, so it renders its own `<html>` and `<body>`.   |
| `not-found.tsx`    | UI for `notFound()` and for URLs that match no route.                                   |
| `forbidden.tsx`    | UI for `forbidden()` (403). Experimental, enabled with `experimental.authInterrupts`.   |
| `unauthorized.tsx` | UI for `unauthorized()` (401). Experimental, same flag.                                 |
| `default.tsx`      | Fallback for a parallel slot that has no match on a full page load.                     |

How these nest inside each other is shown in [docs/layouts.md](docs/layouts.md#component-hierarchy).

## Behaviour worth knowing

### Parallel slots keep their state on client navigation

A slot is a prop of the layout at the same level, and only renders where that layout places it. On client navigation an unmatched slot keeps its last active page; on a full page load it renders `default.tsx`. Try it: open `/`, follow a link, and the `@analytics` panel stays; reload, and it is gone.

Since Next.js 16 a slot without `default.tsx` fails the build when its layout has child routes. `app/dashboard/@sidebar/default.tsx` re-exports the sidebar page, so `/dashboard/settings` shows the same sidebar after a reload.

### Interception only happens on client navigation

Clicking a photo on `/feed` renders `app/feed/@modal/(..)photo/[id]` inside a `<dialog>`, with the feed still behind it. Esc, a backdrop click or the Close button call `router.back()`. Loading `/photo/1` directly or reloading renders the full page in `app/photo/[id]`. That canonical page is required: since Next.js 16.4 the build fails if an interception route has none.

### Streaming fixes the status code

`/account` returns a real 401, `/account?as=user` a 403. That only works because no `loading.tsx` sits above `/account`. A `loading.tsx` makes the page stream, and once streaming has started the status is already 200: `notFound()`, `forbidden()` and `unauthorized()` then only swap the UI and add a `noindex` tag. This is why the only `loading.tsx` in the repo lives on the reviews route, where `getReview()` simulates a slow fetch.

### A required and an optional catch-all can't share a folder

`help/[...slug]` and `help/[[...slug]]` side by side would both match every non-empty path. Next.js refuses to build that (in 16.2 and 16.4 with an internal `InvariantError` while collecting page data), so the two variants live under different parents here.

### Proxy is not an authorization layer

`proxy.ts` replaced `middleware.ts`, which still works but is deprecated. Proxy runs on the Node.js runtime and suits redirects, rewrites, headers and optimistic checks. Server Actions are POST requests to the page that uses them, so a matcher change can silently stop covering them: check authorization where data is read or changed.

## Type-safe routing

`next typegen` (also run by `next dev` and `next build`) turns the route tree into global types, so no `params` type is written by hand:

- `PageProps<'/blog/[slug]'>` for pages and `generateMetadata`
- `LayoutProps<'/dashboard'>` for layouts, including their slots (`sidebar`)
- `RouteContext<'/api/posts/[id]'>` for route handlers

With `typedRoutes: true` in `next.config.ts`, every literal `<Link href>` is checked against the same tree, so a typo such as `/prodcts/1` fails type-checking. Hrefs built at runtime, like the breadcrumb's, need an explicit `as Route` cast. The `typecheck` script runs `next typegen` first, so it works on a fresh checkout without a build.

## Deployment

The app needs a Node.js server or a platform such as Vercel. It uses Proxy, Server Actions, route handlers and request-time rendering, so a static export (`output: 'export'`) is not an option.

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
